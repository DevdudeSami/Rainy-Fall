Give Yasmin a list of assets to make w/ dimensions:

I put the older assets in the Old Assets folder. Those 4 are the main ones, and you can use them as reference, especially for sizes.

What I'm looking for mainly is well animated versions of those. The background especially I would like to have a large canvas that animates through a sprite sheet. Make it as big as possible (maybe 3500x3500 so it would work on large and small devices without scaling (clipping instead, for iPhones e.g.).

For the fire, rain and clouds, I would like animated variations of each one. The variations don't need to be too different, just different enough. The same sizes as the ones in the old assets folder should be fine.

Thanks Yas <3
